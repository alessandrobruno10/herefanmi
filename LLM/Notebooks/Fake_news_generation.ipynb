today promised rapid and sustained action to tackle the overprescribing of psychotropic drugs to people with learning disabilities after three separate reports highlighted the need for change Research commissioned by the health body and delivered in three reports from the Care Quality Commission Public Health England and NHS Improving Quality has found that There is a much higher rate of prescribing of medicines associated with mental illness amongst people with learning disabilities than the general population often more than one medicine in the same class and in the majority of cases with no clear justification Medicines are often used for long periods without adequate review and There is poor communication with parents and carers and between different healthcare providers One of the reports authored by Public Health England estimates that up to 35000 adults with a learning disability are being prescribed an antipsychotic an antidepressant or both without appropriate clinical justification In a letter also available in easy read to professionals and patients NHS England officials have urged the review of prescriptions and promised to spearhead a call to action to tackle these problems similar to that which has been so effective in reducing the inappropriate use of antipsychotics with dementia patients This will involve bringing together representatives of both professional and patient groups for an urgent summit on 17 July at which an action plan and a delivery board will be established to drive the necessary changes NHS England are also considering issuing a patient safety alert to ensure that frontline clinicians and other health professionals are aware of the concerns and have published information on their website for concerned patients and family members Dominic Slowie NHS Englands National Clinical Director for Learning Disabilities said This is a historic problem but one that nobody knew the true scale of thats why we worked with patients carers and professionals to get to the bottom of the issues once and for all These medicines can be helpful when used appropriately and kept under review but the prevalence and the lack of review or challenge that these reports have highlighted is completely unacceptable and we are determined to take action to protect this group of patients from overmedication While no specific research has been undertaken on the physical health implications of longterm use of such drugs on people with learning disabilities past studies looking at patients with schizophrenia and dementia highlighted significantly increased risk of movement disorders anticholinergic effects stroke and death Individuals and their loved ones who are concerned with a current prescription are encouraged not to stop taking medication immediately but to consult their doctor or supervising clinician as soon as possible Gyles Glover Consultant in public health and CoDirector of the Learning Disabilities team in Public Health England said Psychiatric drugs are often given to people with learning disabilities to try and manage challenging behaviour These drugs have important side effects but the evidence that they are effective is limited Services are overstretched and care is demanding so we understand how the use of these drugs can be considered normal or necessary However the report which is the first of its kind suggests that psychiatric drugs are used more widely than is appropriate and this comes with risk It is crucial that we build our evidence of what drugs are being used to manage behaviour and how often to support and guide a change in practice Zoe Lord Improvement Manager at NHS Improving Quality said We have highlighted a significant need to improve the use of medicines for people with learning disabilities Across the country there is a great deal of variation in practice and this does not provide the necessary highquality optimised care for everyone We have tested new ways of working with our partnership sites and propose six recommendations to improve care for service users and their families Information for patients and their families and carers who believe they may be affected is now available also in easy read In summary the advice to patients is as follows Dont stop taking medicines or change them without professional medical advice first doing so could be dangerous Speak to the person responsible for prescribing these medicines as soon as possible and ask for them to be reviewed This will usually be your GP specialist doctor pharmacist or nurse prescriber Please remember not all medicines that are prescribed to treat people with learning disabilities are antipsychotic or sedative medicines if you have any concerns please check and speak to the person responsible for prescribing them GP specialist doctor pharmacist or nurse prescriber antipsychotic and sedative drugs can be effective in treating some people with learning disabilities when used appropriately Reports A report of the primary care subscribing study has been published by Public Health England on the Learning Disabilities Team website NHS Improving Quality has published a full report on the pilot improvement project which examined medicines practices and related matters in six sites across England which provide care for those with learning disabilities A summary of the CQCs Second Opinion Authorised Doctor information work is available in the letter The full report will be published by CQC in September\",\n          \"Clinical commissioning group authorisation Draft guide for applicants has been published following its formal ratification at the Board meeting of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority NHS CBA on 13 April 2012 The guide is still formally a draft because the authorisation regulations have yet to be passed by Parliament As such the final version is scheduled to be published in October 2012 once the NHS Commissioning Board is established However emerging CCGs should use this document as the basis for their authorisation applications SHA clusters are working with their CCGs to agree which application wave each CCG will go into by 30 April 2012 and when all emerging CCG intentions are known the NHS CBA will assess the national picture to ensure that the overall authorisation pipeline is deliverable If there is any need to adjust numbers between waves this will be done in discussion with SHA clusters There is no advantage in being part of any particular wave as all CCGs will take on their new commissioning duties if authorised on 1 April 2013 regardless of when they were authorised Work is also underway to develop and finalise the assessment process the NHS CBA has been testing the 360degree stakeholder survey working with six emerging CCGs to test the questionnaire and develop an information pack assessors are being appointed and an assessors guide developed An Authorisation Stakeholder Group has also been set up involving nine GP clinical leads from across the country who will feed in their views on the design of the process and its implementation as the work develops Authorisation surgeries will be run in each region to support emerging CCGs in putting their applications together more details on these will be available soon View all clinical commissioning group authorisation resources Comments on this page are now closed\",\n          \"NHS England has announced a major expansion of a landmark scheme designed to help tens of thousands of patients with serious mental health problems who want to work to find employment The voluntary scheme known as Individual Placement and Support IPS is being rolled out to 28 new local NHS areas meaning eight out of ten parts of England will have access to the programme Access is expected to double to 20000 people per year by 202021 and will continue to expand as part of the NHS Long Term Plan helping 55000 people each year by 202324 Patients hoping to get back into work can be referred directly by their doctor or another mental health professional and can also selfrefer Employment specialists offer coaching and advice along with practical tips on finding a job and preparing for interviews They can also search for jobs and engage with employers directly on patients behalf to identify wellsuited roles acting as a crucial link between patient their employer and medical team Patients can call on the trained specialists who are embedded within health teams at any time They work alongside psychologists mental health nurses and other health professionals and can speak to potential employers about how best to support people so that they can work effectively while staying in good health These schemes have also been shown to be costeffective A Centre for Mental Health review calculated that they can free up as much as 6000 per patient over 18 months which can be invested in other frontline care Claire Murdoch NHS England national mental health director said The goals and aspirations of someone living with severe mental illness are the same as anyone elses steady employment and an active life As the NHS Long Term Plan makes clear stable employment is a major factor in maintaining good health and is an important outcome for recovery Those in work tend to be in better health visit their GP less and are less likely to need hospital treatment which is good individuals themselves as well as being better for the economy Prime Minister Theresa May said Helping those with mental ill health back into work is one of the best ways to ensure their health and happiness in the long term This scheme is another important step forward in achieving that goal The Government is working hard to ensure genuine parity of esteem between physical and mental health conditions and our Long Term Plan will make the NHS a world leader in the care and support we provide to those who need it To help ramp up services NHS England has launched IPS Grow in partnership with Social Finance a notforprofit organisation who will work with service providers and a range of employment specialists mental health experts and academics to support services across the country To deliver the major expansion services across England will employ hundreds of additional IPS employment specialists and team leaders with IPS Grow providing hands on operational and local support Including support to recruit and train hundreds more staff Paul Farmer Chief Executive of Mind said We know that being able to work is an important part of keeping mentally well for many people and everyone experiencing a mental health problem has the right to dignity and respect including accessing work if its right for them Ensuring that employers and organisations know how to support staff with mental health problems is a key part of this as well as recognition that each individual will have differing experiences We are pleased that the NHS is continuing its commitment to expanding Individual Placement and Support schemes to work oneonone with more people across England The IPS approach is the best evidenced and most successful way of supporting people into work because it puts the individual at the heart of the support Commitment to expanding this was a major part of the 5 Year Forward View for Mental Health and its welcome to see extra funding to make this more available to people on a voluntary basis Lynne Miller IPS Grow National Lead said For many people accessing mental health services getting the right job can be life changing and key to their recovery IPS offers the vital help that so many people who experience mental illness need to fulfil their ambitions and become more connected to their local communities The health service ultimately expects the programme to support as many as 115000 patients each year by the end of the decade Based on over 20 years of research including 22 randomised control trials the IPS employment model is internationally recognised as the most effective way to support people with mental health problems to gain and keep paid employment On average people who receive IPS show employment rates of 3040 compared to rates in the control group of 1012 Those supported by IPS work significantly more hours per month and have higher earnings and better job tenure while some show reduced rates of hospital admission and less time spent in hospital\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
