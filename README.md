HeReFaNMi stands for Healthcare-Related Fake News Detection. It is a project funded by NGI-Search 

## context 

In the era of the next generation of the internet, where information flows freely and instantaneously, the challenge of combating fake news and misinformation has become even more critical. The Covid-19 pandemic has vividly demonstrated the detrimental effects of widespread dissemination of inaccurate health-related information, eroding public trust in official guidelines and posing significant obstacles to public health efforts.

HeRe-FaNMi (Health-related Fake News Monitoring) stands at the forefront of tackling this pressing issue, fueled by the determination to combat the propagation of fake news within health-related information and restore trustworthiness to the internet community. This pioneering project is driven by recognizing the severe consequences of misinformation, including the promotion of ineffective remedies, the downplaying of risks, and the erosion of public confidence in scientific research.

At its core, HeRe-FaNMi aims to develop an autonomous system equipped with the capacity for continual learning, leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to discriminate between genuine and deceptive medical news effectively. Utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, HeRe-FaNMi endeavors to provide individuals with an automated and reliable solution that safeguards them against misinformation while concurrently promoting the dissemination of accurate health information. By harnessing the power of technology, HeRe-FaNMi aspires to contribute to the enhancement of overall societal well-being and public health outcomes.
