## HeReFaNMi ðŸš€
HeReFaNMi  is one of ten <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/blogs/l-esprit-libre/ngi-search-la-commission-europeenne-finance-dix-logiciels-open-source-de-recherche-39960000.htm"> NGI search</a> project stands for Health-Related Fake News Mitigation. It's an AI-beased system designed to detect and identify fake news related healthcare.
The proposed system will use continuous learning to distinguish between fake news and real news. Current NLP techniques for detecting fake news have limitations, as most rely on supervised learning. The proposed system aims to overcome these limitations by continuously updating the knowledge base with emerging events.

## Automatic web scraping framework ðŸš€
<p>As part of this project, we developed an automatic web scraping framework that will automatically scrape data from various online sources. Currently, we are utilizing 8 credible platforms:
  <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">  CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)</a>:  The CDC is the national public
health agency of the United States, operating under <B> the Department of Health and Human
Services </B>. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and it provides authoritative information on various
health-related topics.
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS (National Health Service) </a>: The NHS is a <B> government-funded healthcare platform in the United Kingdom </B>. Established in 1948, it provides comprehensive medical services to residents, primarily financed through taxation and It operates under the oversight of government health departments in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, offering healthcare that is largely free at the point of use.</li>

## Data Collection and Availability ðŸš€

As part of the HeReFaNMi project, we have successfully collected an extensive dataset of around **800,000 data points** related to healthcare news using our automatic web scraping framework. This dataset is aimed at improving the system's ability to distinguish between fake and real healthcare news through continuous learning.

The collected dataset is **publicly available** and can be accessed via the following [link](https://github.com/Walid-Taib/web-scraping-framework/blob/main/dataset.pdf). We encourage the community to explore and utilize the dataset for further research and advancements in mitigating health-related fake news.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Use Git to clone this repository from your GitHub account.

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   Use your terminal or command prompt to navigate to the newly cloned repository directory.

3. **Install frontend dependencies:**

   Go to the `frontend` directory and run the appropriate command (e.g., `npm install` or `yarn install`) to install the necessary frontend libraries.

4. **Set up backend environment:**

   Go to the `Backend` directory and run the appropriate command `pip install requirements.txt` to install the necessary backend libraries.

## Running the Application

### Frontend

1. **Start the development server:**

   This typically involves running a command `npm start` in the `frontend` directory. The server will launch the frontend application in your web browser, usually accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port depending on your setup).

### Backend

1. **Start the backend server:**

   This typically involves running a specific file by `python server.py` in the `backend` directory. The backend server will typically listen on a specific port (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`). Consult the  backend framework's documentation for details.
